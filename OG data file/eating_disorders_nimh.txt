Eating disorders are serious illnesses characterized by severe disturbances in eating behaviors. While many people may occasionally be concerned about health, weight, or appearance, eating disorders involve an intense fixation on weight loss, body weight or shape, and controlling food intake.

An excessive preoccupation with weight, body shape, or strict control over eating behaviors may be signs of an eating disorder. These concerns go beyond occasional worries and can significantly affect daily life.

Eating disorders are serious and can be life-threatening. Individuals with eating disorders are at higher risk of medical complications and co-occurring mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. These co-occurring conditions may worsen eating disorder symptoms.

Eating disorders can be treated successfully, and early detection and appropriate support are important for recovery and long-term well-being.
