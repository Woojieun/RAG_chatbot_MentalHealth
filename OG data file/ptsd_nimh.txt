After experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, such as a natural disaster, act of violence, or serious accident, people may have a range of reactions. Common responses include feeling anxious, sad, or angry; having difficulty concentrating or sleeping; and repeatedly thinking about the event. For most people, these reactions gradually lessen over time.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be diagnosed when symptoms persist for an extended period after a traumatic event and begin to interfere with daily life, such as work or relationships. People with PTSD may continue to feel stressed or frightened even when they are no longer in danger.

Symptoms of PTSD can cause significant distress and interfere with daily activities, including sleeping and eating. These difficulties can affect overall functioning and quality of life.

People with PTSD often experience co-occurring mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety disorders, or substance use disorders.

Certain biological, social, and experiential factors can influence the likelihood of developing PTSD. Prior exposure to adversity or traumatic experiences, particularly during childhood, may increase risk. However, many people who experience traumatic events do not develop PTSD, and multiple factors contribute to outcomes.
