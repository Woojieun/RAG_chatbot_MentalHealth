Anxiety is a normal part of life, and many people experience worry related to health, money, school, work, or family. However, anxiety disorders involve more than occasional worry or fear. In anxiety disorders, feelings of anxiety do not go away, are present in many situations, and may worsen over time.

There are several types of anxiety disorders. These include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and various phobia-related disorders.

About one third of adolescents and adults in the United States experience an anxiety disorder at some point in their lives. Anxiety disorder symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, schoolwork, and personal relationships.

In severe cases, anxiety disorders can cause intense fear in common situations. Some individuals may avoid social interactions or refuse to leave their home due to overwhelming anxiety.
