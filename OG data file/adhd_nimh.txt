Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a developmental disorder characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. These symptoms go beyond occasional difficulties and affect daily functioning across multiple settings.

ADHD symptoms generally fall into three categories. Inattention may involve difficulty focusing, staying on task, or remaining organized. Hyperactivity can include excessive movement, restlessness, or excessive talking. Impulsivity may involve interrupting others, intruding, or difficulty waiting for one’s turn.

Many people occasionally show behaviors such as inattention or impulsivity. In individuals with ADHD, these behaviors occur frequently and across multiple settings, such as school, home, work, or social situations.

ADHD is one of the most commonly diagnosed developmental disorders in children. Symptoms typically begin in childhood and often continue into adolescence and adulthood. ADHD frequently co-occurs with other conditions, including learning disorders, sleep problems, anxiety, or depression.

For many people, ADHD symptoms can interfere with daily life. These difficulties may affect school performance, work productivity, and social relationships. Children with ADHD may face higher risks of injuries, social challenges, family stress, and academic difficulties.

Adolescents and adults with ADHD may be more likely to engage in risky behaviors, such as substance use or unsafe activities, which can further affect health and well-being.
