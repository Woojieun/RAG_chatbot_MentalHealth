### Chunk 1: Key facts
Mental health – Key facts
Globally, more than a billion people live with a mental health condition. Affordable, effective and feasible strategies exist to promote, protect and restore mental health. The need for action on mental health is indisputable and urgent. Mental health has intrinsic and instrumental value and is integral to our well-being.

### Chunk 2: Definition of mental health
Mental health – Definition
Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn and work well, and contribute to their community. It has intrinsic and instrumental value and is a basic human right.

### Chunk 3: Mental health continuum and determinants
Mental health – Continuum and determinants
Mental health exists on a complex continuum, which is experienced differently from one person to the next. At any one time, a diverse set of individual, family, community and structural factors may combine to protect or undermine mental health. Although most people are resilient, people who are exposed to adverse circumstances are at higher risk of developing a mental health condition.

### Chunk 4: Mental health conditions
Mental health conditions – Overview
Mental health conditions include mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities as well as other mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or risk of self-harm. Many mental health conditions can be effectively treated at relatively low cost, yet health systems remain significantly under-resourced and treatment gaps are wide all over the world.

### Chunk 5: Risk factors (individual)
Mental health – Individual risk factors
Individual factors such as emotional skills, substance use and genetics can increase vulnerability to mental health problems.

### Chunk 6: Risk factors (social and environmental)
Mental health – Social and environmental risk factors
Social and environmental factors – including poverty, violence, inequality and environmental deprivation – increase the risk of experiencing mental health conditions.

### Chunk 7: Developmental risks
Mental health – Developmental risk factors
Risks can emerge at any stage of life, but those occurring during sensitive developmental periods, especially early childhood, are particularly harmful. Harsh parenting and physical punishment can damage child health, and bullying is a leading risk factor for mental health conditions.

### Chunk 8: Protective factors
Mental health – Protective factors
Protective factors occur throughout life and help build resilience. They include social and emotional skills, positive social interactions, access to quality education, decent work, safe neighbourhoods and strong community ties.

### Chunk 9: Local and global influences
Mental health – Local and global influences
Mental health risks and protective factors operate at different scales. Local challenges affect individuals, families and communities, while global threats such as economic downturns, disease outbreaks, humanitarian emergencies, forced displacement and climate change impact entire populations.

### Chunk 10: Predictability of outcomes
Mental health – Outcome variability
No single factor can reliably predict mental health outcomes. Many people exposed to risk factors never develop a mental health condition, while others may be affected without any known risk. The interplay of determinants collectively shapes mental health over time.

### Chunk 11: Promotion and prevention
Mental health promotion and prevention
Promotion and prevention efforts aim to improve mental health by addressing individual, social and structural determinants. Interventions may target individuals, specific groups or whole populations.

### Chunk 12: Cross-sector collaboration
Mental health – Cross-sector collaboration
Because many determinants lie outside the health sector, effective mental health promotion and prevention require collaboration across education, labour, justice, transport, environment, housing and welfare sectors. The health sector contributes by embedding promotion and prevention into services and supporting multisectoral coordination.

### Chunk 13: Suicide prevention
Mental health – Suicide prevention
Suicide prevention is a global priority and part of the Sustainable Development Goals. Key strategies include limiting access to means, responsible media reporting, social and emotional learning for adolescents, and early intervention. Banning highly hazardous pesticides is a particularly cost-effective intervention.

### Chunk 14: Child and adolescent mental health
Mental health – Child and adolescent focus
Promoting child and adolescent mental health is a priority. Effective approaches include protective policies and laws, caregiver support, school-based programmes and improved community and online environments. School-based social and emotional learning programmes are especially effective across income levels.

### Chunk 15: Mental health at work
Mental health at work
Mental health at work can be supported through legislation, regulation, workplace policies, manager training and targeted worker interventions.

### Chunk 16: Community-based care
Mental health care – Community-based approach
National mental health efforts should promote well-being for all and address the needs of people with mental health conditions. Community-based care is more accessible and acceptable than institutional care, prevents human rights violations and improves recovery outcomes.

### Chunk 17: Integrated service model
Mental health care – Service network
Effective community-based care includes integrated mental health services within general health care, dedicated community mental health services such as rehabilitation and peer support, and mental health support in non-health settings including schools, child protection services and prisons.

### Chunk 18: Addressing care gaps
Mental health care – Expanding access
Large care gaps for common mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety require innovative approaches, including non-specialist psychological interventions and scalable digital self-help tools.
