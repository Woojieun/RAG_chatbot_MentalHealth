Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves.

People with schizophrenia may appear to have lost touch with reality, which can be distressing for the individual and for their family and friends.

Schizophrenia is most often diagnosed between the ages of 16 and 30, typically after a person experiences their first episode of psychosis.

Schizophrenia symptoms can make it difficult to participate in everyday activities and are often associated with significant health, social, and economic challenges.

Many people with schizophrenia experience a delay between the onset of symptoms and the start of treatment, which can negatively affect long-term health and well-being.

Research shows that gradual changes in thinking, mood, and social functioning often appear before the first episode of psychosis.

Early identification and treatment can help people with schizophrenia improve their long-term health, engage in school or work, achieve independence, and maintain personal relationships.
