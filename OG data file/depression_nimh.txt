Depression, also known as major depressive disorder or clinical depression, is a mental illness that causes persistent feelings of sadness or low mood that do not simply pass with time. It affects how a person feels, thinks, and manages daily activities.

While everyone feels sad or low at times, these feelings usually improve over time. Depression is different because symptoms are more severe, last longer, and interfere with daily functioning.

Depression can interfere with daily activities such as sleeping, eating, working, and concentrating. Symptoms may range from mild to severe and can disrupt a person’s ability to function normally.

Depression can affect anyone, regardless of age, race, income, culture, or education level. It is not limited to a specific group of people.

Research suggests that depression is influenced by a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. No single cause explains why depression develops.

Depression is a serious mental disorder that can increase the risk of other health conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes. It is also a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
