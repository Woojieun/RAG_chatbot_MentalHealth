Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental disorder characterized by uncontrollable and recurring thoughts, known as obsessions, repetitive and excessive behaviors, known as compulsions, or both.

Obsessions are unwanted and recurring thoughts, urges, or images that cause distress. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that a person feels driven to perform in response to obsessions.

OCD symptoms can begin at any age but most commonly start between late childhood and young adulthood.

OCD symptoms are often time-consuming and can cause significant distress or interfere with daily activities, including work, school, and relationships.

It is common for people with OCD to also have other mental health conditions, such as mood disorders or anxiety disorders.

Although there is no cure for OCD, available treatments can help people manage their symptoms, participate in daily activities, and improve their quality of life.
