Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a mental illness that affects a person’s ability to regulate emotions. Difficulties with emotional regulation can increase impulsive behaviors, influence how a person perceives themselves, and negatively affect relationships with others.

Borderline personality disorder can cause significant challenges in emotional well-being and interpersonal relationships. Difficulties with emotional control may lead to intense emotional experiences and unstable relationships.

People with borderline personality disorder are more likely to engage in self-harm behaviors. They may also experience symptoms of other mental health conditions, such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, or eating disorders.

The challenges associated with borderline personality disorder can result in significant distress and reduced quality of life. However, effective treatments and supports can help individuals manage symptoms, support well-being, and improve daily functioning.
