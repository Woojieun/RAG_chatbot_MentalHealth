Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave. Autism can be diagnosed at any age, but it is considered a developmental disorder because symptoms typically appear during the first two years of life.

People with autism spectrum disorder can have a wide range of symptoms. These may include differences in social interaction and communication, intellectual disabilities, and other physical or mental health conditions.

People with autism often have diverse health care and service needs. Research indicates that access to appropriate services and supports early in life can improve long-term health and well-being.
