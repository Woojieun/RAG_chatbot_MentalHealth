Bipolar disorder is a mental illness characterized by clear shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration. These changes go beyond normal mood variations and can significantly affect daily functioning.

People with bipolar disorder may experience manic episodes, which involve periods of extremely elevated, energized, irritable, or elated mood. During these episodes, individuals may feel unusually active or driven.

Bipolar disorder also includes depressive episodes, marked by periods of very low mood, sadness, indifference, or feelings of hopelessness. These episodes can reduce motivation, energy, and interest in daily activities.

People with bipolar disorder often have other co-occurring mental disorders. Some individuals may experience symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations or delusions, particularly during severe mood episodes.

The symptoms of bipolar disorder can interfere with everyday activities, including relationships, work, and school responsibilities. Some people also experience stigma related to their symptoms, which can discourage them from seeking help.

Bipolar disorder is typically a long-term condition that requires ongoing management. While symptoms can be challenging, effective support and treatment can help individuals improve their quality of life.
