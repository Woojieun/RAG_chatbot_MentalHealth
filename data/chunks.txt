Mental health – Key facts
Globally, more than a billion people live with a mental health condition. Affordable, effective and feasible strategies exist to promote, protect and restore mental health. The need for action on mental health is indisputable and urgent. Mental health has intrinsic and instrumental value and is integral to our well-being.

[CHUNK]
Mental health – Definition
Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn and work well, and contribute to their community. It has intrinsic and instrumental value and is a basic human right.

[CHUNK]
Mental health – Continuum and determinants
Mental health exists on a complex continuum, which is experienced differently from one person to the next. At any one time, a diverse set of individual, family, community and structural factors may combine to protect or undermine mental health. Although most people are resilient, people who are exposed to adverse circumstances are at higher risk of developing a mental health condition.

[CHUNK]
Mental health conditions – Overview
Mental health conditions include mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities as well as other mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or risk of self-harm. Many mental health conditions can be effectively treated at relatively low cost, yet health systems remain significantly under-resourced and treatment gaps are wide all over the world.

Mental health – Individual risk factors
Individual factors such as emotional skills, substance use and genetics can increase vulnerability to mental health problems.

[CHUNK]
Mental health – Social and environmental risk factors
Social and environmental factors – including poverty, violence, inequality and environmental deprivation – increase the risk of experiencing mental health conditions.

[CHUNK]
Mental health – Developmental risk factors
Risks can emerge at any stage of life, but those occurring during sensitive developmental periods, especially early childhood, are particularly harmful. Harsh parenting and physical punishment can damage child health, and bullying is a leading risk factor for mental health conditions.

[CHUNK]
Mental health – Protective factors
Protective factors occur throughout life and help build resilience. They include social and emotional skills, positive social interactions, access to quality education, decent work, safe neighbourhoods and strong community ties.

[CHUNK]
Mental health – Local and global influences
Mental health risks and protective factors operate at different scales. Local challenges affect individuals, families and communities, while global threats such as economic downturns, disease outbreaks, humanitarian emergencies, forced displacement and climate change impact entire populations.

[CHUNK]
Mental health – Outcome variability
No single factor can reliably predict mental health outcomes. Many people exposed to risk factors never develop a mental health condition, while others may be affected without any known risk. The interplay of determinants collectively shapes mental health over time.

[CHUNK]
Mental health promotion and prevention
Promotion and prevention efforts aim to improve mental health by addressing individual, social and structural determinants. Interventions may target individuals, specific groups or whole populations.

[CHUNK]
Mental health – Cross-sector collaboration
Because many determinants lie outside the health sector, effective mental health promotion and prevention require collaboration across education, labour, justice, transport, environment, housing and welfare sectors. The health sector contributes by embedding promotion and prevention into services and supporting multisectoral coordination.

Mental health – Suicide prevention
Suicide prevention is a global priority and part of the Sustainable Development Goals. Key strategies include limiting access to means, responsible media reporting, social and emotional learning for adolescents, and early intervention. Banning highly hazardous pesticides is a particularly cost-effective intervention.

[CHUNK]
Mental health – Child and adolescent focus
Promoting child and adolescent mental health is a priority. Effective approaches include protective policies and laws, caregiver support, school-based programmes and improved community and online environments. School-based social and emotional learning programmes are especially effective across income levels.

[CHUNK]
Mental health at work
Mental health at work can be supported through legislation, regulation, workplace policies, manager training and targeted worker interventions.

[CHUNK]
Mental health care – Community-based approach
National mental health efforts should promote well-being for all and address the needs of people with mental health conditions. Community-based care is more accessible and acceptable than institutional care, prevents human rights violations and improves recovery outcomes.

[CHUNK]
Mental health care – Service network
Effective community-based care includes integrated mental health services within general health care, dedicated community mental health services such as rehabilitation and peer support, and mental health support in non-health settings including schools, child protection services and prisons.

[CHUNK]
Mental health care – Expanding access
Large care gaps for common mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety require innovative approaches, including non-specialist psychological interventions and scalable digital self-help tools.

Anxiety is a normal part of life, and many people experience worry related to health, money, school, work, or family.
However, anxiety disorders involve more than occasional worry or fear.
In anxiety disorders, feelings of anxiety do not go away, are present in many situations, and may worsen over time.

There are several types of anxiety disorders.
These include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and various phobia-related disorders.

About one third of adolescents and adults in the United States experience an anxiety disorder at some point in their lives.
Anxiety disorder symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, schoolwork, and personal relationships.

In severe cases, anxiety disorders can cause intense fear in common situations.
Some individuals may avoid social interactions or refuse to leave their home due to overwhelming anxiety.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave. Autism can be diagnosed at any age, but it is considered a developmental disorder because symptoms typically appear during the first two years of life.

People with autism spectrum disorder can have a wide range of symptoms. These may include differences in social interaction and communication, intellectual disabilities, and other physical or mental health conditions.

People with autism often have diverse health care and service needs. Research indicates that access to appropriate services and supports early in life can improve long-term health and well-being.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a mental illness that affects a person’s ability to regulate emotions. Difficulties with emotional regulation can increase impulsive behaviors, influence how a person perceives themselves, and negatively affect relationships with others.

Borderline personality disorder can cause significant challenges in emotional well-being and interpersonal relationships. Difficulties with emotional control may lead to intense emotional experiences and unstable relationships.

People with borderline personality disorder are more likely to engage in self-harm behaviors. They may also experience symptoms of other mental health conditions, such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, or eating disorders.

The challenges associated with borderline personality disorder can result in significant distress and reduced quality of life. However, effective treatments and supports can help individuals manage symptoms, support well-being, and improve daily functioning.

After experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, such as a natural disaster, act of violence, or serious accident, people may have a range of reactions. Common responses include feeling anxious, sad, or angry; having difficulty concentrating or sleeping; and repeatedly thinking about the event. For most people, these reactions gradually lessen over time.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be diagnosed when symptoms persist for an extended period after a traumatic event and begin to interfere with daily life, such as work or relationships. People with PTSD may continue to feel stressed or frightened even when they are no longer in danger.

Symptoms of PTSD can cause significant distress and interfere with daily activities, including sleeping and eating. These difficulties can affect overall functioning and quality of life.

People with PTSD often experience co-occurring mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety disorders, or substance use disorders.

Certain biological, social, and experiential factors can influence the likelihood of developing PTSD. Prior exposure to adversity or traumatic experiences, particularly during childhood, may increase risk. However, many people who experience traumatic events do not develop PTSD, and multiple factors contribute to outcomes.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a developmental disorder characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. These symptoms go beyond occasional difficulties and affect daily functioning across multiple settings.

ADHD symptoms generally fall into three categories. Inattention may involve difficulty focusing, staying on task, or remaining organized. Hyperactivity can include excessive movement, restlessness, or excessive talking. Impulsivity may involve interrupting others, intruding, or difficulty waiting for one’s turn.

Many people occasionally show behaviors such as inattention or impulsivity. In individuals with ADHD, these behaviors occur frequently and across multiple settings, such as school, home, work, or social situations.

ADHD is one of the most commonly diagnosed developmental disorders in children. Symptoms typically begin in childhood and often continue into adolescence and adulthood. ADHD frequently co-occurs with other conditions, including learning disorders, sleep problems, anxiety, or depression.

For many people, ADHD symptoms can interfere with daily life. These difficulties may affect school performance, work productivity, and social relationships. Children with ADHD may face higher risks of injuries, social challenges, family stress, and academic difficulties.

Adolescents and adults with ADHD may be more likely to engage in risky behaviors, such as substance use or unsafe activities, which can further affect health and well-being.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental disorder characterized by uncontrollable and recurring thoughts, known as obsessions, repetitive and excessive behaviors, known as compulsions, or both.

Obsessions are unwanted and recurring thoughts, urges, or images that cause distress. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that a person feels driven to perform in response to obsessions.

OCD symptoms can begin at any age but most commonly start between late childhood and young adulthood.

OCD symptoms are often time-consuming and can cause significant distress or interfere with daily activities, including work, school, and relationships.

It is common for people with OCD to also have other mental health conditions, such as mood disorders or anxiety disorders.

Although there is no cure for OCD, available treatments can help people manage their symptoms, participate in daily activities, and improve their quality of life.

Bipolar disorder is a mental illness characterized by clear shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration. These changes go beyond normal mood variations and can significantly affect daily functioning.

People with bipolar disorder may experience manic episodes, which involve periods of extremely elevated, energized, irritable, or elated mood. During these episodes, individuals may feel unusually active or driven.

Bipolar disorder also includes depressive episodes, marked by periods of very low mood, sadness, indifference, or feelings of hopelessness. These episodes can reduce motivation, energy, and interest in daily activities.

People with bipolar disorder often have other co-occurring mental disorders. Some individuals may experience symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations or delusions, particularly during severe mood episodes.

The symptoms of bipolar disorder can interfere with everyday activities, including relationships, work, and school responsibilities. Some people also experience stigma related to their symptoms, which can discourage them from seeking help.

Bipolar disorder is typically a long-term condition that requires ongoing management. While symptoms can be challenging, effective support and treatment can help individuals improve their quality of life.

Depression, also known as major depressive disorder or clinical depression, is a mental illness that causes persistent feelings of sadness or low mood that do not simply pass with time. It affects how a person feels, thinks, and manages daily activities.

While everyone feels sad or low at times, these feelings usually improve over time. Depression is different because symptoms are more severe, last longer, and interfere with daily functioning.

Depression can interfere with daily activities such as sleeping, eating, working, and concentrating. Symptoms may range from mild to severe and can disrupt a person’s ability to function normally.

Depression can affect anyone, regardless of age, race, income, culture, or education level. It is not limited to a specific group of people.

Research suggests that depression is influenced by a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. No single cause explains why depression develops.

Depression is a serious mental disorder that can increase the risk of other health conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes. It is also a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

Eating disorders are serious illnesses characterized by severe disturbances in eating behaviors. While many people may occasionally be concerned about health, weight, or appearance, eating disorders involve an intense fixation on weight loss, body weight or shape, and controlling food intake.

An excessive preoccupation with weight, body shape, or strict control over eating behaviors may be signs of an eating disorder. These concerns go beyond occasional worries and can significantly affect daily life.

Eating disorders are serious and can be life-threatening. Individuals with eating disorders are at higher risk of medical complications and co-occurring mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. These co-occurring conditions may worsen eating disorder symptoms.

Eating disorders can be treated successfully, and early detection and appropriate support are important for recovery and long-term well-being.

Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves.

People with schizophrenia may appear to have lost touch with reality, which can be distressing for the individual and for their family and friends.

Schizophrenia is most often diagnosed between the ages of 16 and 30, typically after a person experiences their first episode of psychosis.

Schizophrenia symptoms can make it difficult to participate in everyday activities and are often associated with significant health, social, and economic challenges.

Many people with schizophrenia experience a delay between the onset of symptoms and the start of treatment, which can negatively affect long-term health and well-being.

Research shows that gradual changes in thinking, mood, and social functioning often appear before the first episode of psychosis.

Early identification and treatment can help people with schizophrenia improve their long-term health, engage in school or work, achieve independence, and maintain personal relationships.
